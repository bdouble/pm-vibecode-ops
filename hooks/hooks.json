Skip this check entirely for: scripts/, tests/, __tests__/, *.test.*, *.spec.*, config files, documentation, and non-code changes.\n\n2. **Linear ticket status**: If this session used workflow commands (/adaptation, /implementation, /testing, /documentation, /codereview, /security-review) on a Linear ticket, remind the user to verify ticket status is updated.\n\nIf no code changes were made and no workflow commands were used, approve stopping without comment."
